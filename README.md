Just a test repo to familiarize myself with git and github.

I have created accounts on github and Cloud9, along with an initial test repo
and workspace for learning purposes.  This is my first manual edit of a file
using the Cloud9 IDE.  Looks good!

Also, I have now used git for the first time in my life.  I was able to view the
status of my edited README file, add the change so that it can be committed,
diff the staged changes to verify them, and then commit those changes to the
repo.  And all this was done from the Cloud9 Console.  Neato!
